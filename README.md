### Hi there, I'm @danh91 (Daniel K) 👋

I'm a product engineer from Canada. 🇨🇮/🇨🇦

I have been working as full-stack developer for just over a decade designing and building APIs and advanced frontend apps for various industries here in Canada.

I created [Karrio (fomerly PurplShip)](https://karrio.io) as part of my deep interest to be part the open source ecosystem.

I like to build well designed APIs and dev tools to make other developers productive with Docker, Python, and TypeScript.

I am currently building a modern Shipping infrastructure at [Teleship](https://www.teleship.com/) a B2C cross-border parcel delivery service for EU and UK-based eCommerce. As part of my work there and in my spare time, I continue to actively maintain Karrio.

I am hoping to make Karrio a sustainable open source shipping solution and build a team of core maintainers.

If Karrio is useful for your **product/company** you can sponsor my work on the project.
